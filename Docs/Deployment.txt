. Update the NuGetPackages as needed.

. Switch to Debug. Clean Solution / Rebuild Solution.

. Run all VS tests.

. Switch to Release. Clean Solution / Rebuild Solution.

. Run all VS tests.

. Rebuild the Bitcoin Database. Run:
    <...>\Sources\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator\bin\Release\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator.exe /BlockchainPath F:\Blockchain\Full\blocks /SQLDbName BitcoinBlockchain /DropDB
  Save the output (it will be copied to log.txt if all validations succeed).

. Run the auto-validation procedure:
    <...>\Sources\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator\bin\Debug\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator.exe /RunValidation /SqlDbName BitcoinBlockchain

. Verify against https://blockchain.info
    - Verify a few blocks. If the new version addresses blockchain format changes target some blocks that have that format change. 
      Use the SQL view: View_BlockAggregated
    - Verify a few transactions. If the new version addresses blockchain format changes target some blocks that have that format change. 
      Use the SQL view: View_TransactionAggregated

. Assuming all is OK, copy the output you saved earlier to:
    <...>\Docs\Logs\log.txt

. Consider regenerating the baseline files used for validation. 
    - In class AutoValidator method ValidateDataAgainstBaseline increase the constant maxBlockchainFileId so that it covers more blockchain files. 
      Do not set the maxBlockchainFileId to the last file since that may be incomplete.
    - Rerun the validation and copy the new dataset files over the baseline files.
